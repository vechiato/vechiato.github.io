<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

This book is an essential guide for engineers looking to elevate their impact and influence within their organizations.</p>

<h4 id="chapter-2-three-maps">Chapter 2: Three Maps</h4>

<p>Time management is crucial for staff engineers who juggle multiple responsibilities.

<h4 id="chapter-7-youre-a-role-model-now-sorry">Chapter 7: You’re a Role Model Now (Sorry)</h4>

<h4 id="chapter-8-good-influence-at-scale">Chapter 8: Good Influence at Scale</h4>
<p>Reilly discusses how staff engineers can extend their influence beyond their immediate teams. By sharing knowledge, advocating for best practices, and driving cultural change, senior engineers can have a broader impact on the organization.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-9-whats-next">Chapter 9: What’s Next?</h4>
<p>The final chapter focuses on personal and professional growth. Reilly provides guidance on how to continue evolving as a staff engineer, exploring new challenges, and planning for the future. The chapter encourages engineers to stay curious, embrace lifelong learning, and seek out new opportunities.</p>
