<p>&ldquo;Platform Engineering on Kubernetes&rdquo; by Mauricio Salatino provides a comprehensive guide to leveraging Kubernetes for platform engineering. This book explores the intricacies of building and maintaining platforms on top of Kubernetes, focusing on the needs of development teams and the challenges of cloud-native environments.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<h3 id="foreword">Foreword</h3>
<p>The foreword by Jared Watts sets the stage by highlighting the importance of platform engineering in the modern cloud-native landscape. He emphasises the need for practical solutions to manage the complexity of integrating various cloud-native tools and technologies.</p>
<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>
<p>Mauricio Salatino shares his journey and the motivations behind writing this book. He reflects on his experiences in the cloud-native communities and the lessons learned from contributing to several open-source projects.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-1-the-rise-of-platforms-on-top-of-kubernetes">Chapter 1: The Rise of Platforms on Top of Kubernetes</h3>
<p>This chapter introduces the concept of platforms and their significance. It explains why platforms are essential for organisations and discusses the advantages of building platforms on top of Kubernetes. The chapter also outlines the challenges associated with platform engineering and the need for a &ldquo;walking skeleton&rdquo; to demonstrate platform concepts.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-cloud-native-application-challenges">Chapter 2: Cloud-Native Application Challenges</h3>
<p>Salatino delves into the challenges of running cloud-native applications on Kubernetes. He covers topics such as choosing the right Kubernetes environment, deploying applications, and troubleshooting common issues. The chapter provides practical advice for managing downtime, ensuring resilience, and handling application state and security.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-3-service-pipelines">Chapter 3: Service Pipelines</h3>
<p>The focus of this chapter is on building service pipelines for continuous delivery of cloud-native applications. Salatino introduces key tools like Tekton and Dagger, and discusses the structure and requirements of effective service pipelines. He provides examples and practical insights on implementing service pipelines in real-world scenarios.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-4-environment-pipelines">Chapter 4: Environment Pipelines</h3>
<p>This chapter explores the concept of environment pipelines and their role in deploying applications across different environments. Salatino explains GitOps and its relation to environment pipelines, using Argo CD as a case study. He discusses the steps involved in creating and managing environment pipelines.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5-multi-cloud-app-infrastructure">Chapter 5: Multi-Cloud (App) Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Salatino addresses the challenges of managing infrastructure in a multi-cloud environment. He introduces Crossplane as a solution for declarative infrastructure management and provides examples of how to integrate services with newly provisioned infrastructure. The chapter highlights the importance of managing infrastructure consistently across multiple cloud providers.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-6-building-a-platform-on-top-of-kubernetes">Chapter 6: Building a Platform on Top of Kubernetes</h3>

He provides a detailed guide on creating a development environment platform using Kubernetes tools.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-7-platform-capabilities-i-shared-application-concerns">Chapter 7: Platform Capabilities I: Shared Application Concerns</h3>
<p>Salatino explores common application concerns such as service-to-service interaction, state management, and asynchronous messaging. He introduces tools like Dapr and OpenFeature to address these concerns and demonstrates how to integrate these tools into the platform.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-8-platform-capabilities-ii-enabling-teams-to-experiment">Chapter 8: Platform Capabilities II: Enabling Teams to Experiment</h3>
<p>This chapter covers advanced release strategies such as canary releases, blue/green deployments, and A/B testing. Salatino discusses the use of Knative Serving and Argo Rollouts to implement these strategies, providing examples and practical tips for managing traffic and ensuring smooth rollouts.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-9-measuring-your-platforms">Chapter 9: Measuring Your Platforms</h3>
<p>Salatino emphasises the importance of measuring platform performance. He introduces DORA metrics and explains how to use CloudEvents and CDEvents for metrics collection. The chapter provides a detailed guide on building a metrics collection pipeline and using tools like Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit for effective measurement.</p>
