While slicers provide estimates of filament usage, they don't account for the actual cost of the filament used, especially when dealing with multiple spools or varying filament prices. To solve this, I developed a Python script that calculates the real cost of a 3D print by leveraging the Spoolman API. In this blog post, I'll walk you through the motivation behind the project, the features of the script, and how you can use it to accurately estimate your 3D printing costs.\nThe Challenge Estimating the cost of a 3D print isn't straightforward when:\nMultiple Spools Are Used: Prints may require filament from different spools, each with different prices, materials, or remaining quantities. Varying Filament Prices: The cost per gram can vary significantly between filament types and vendors. Slicer Limitations: While slicers provide filament usage estimates, they don't integrate actual spool data or costs. This led me to create a solution that considers the actual filament used from specific spools, providing a more accurate cost calculation.\nIntroducing the Filament Cost Calculator The Filament Cost Calculator is a Python script that:\nFetches Spool Data: Retrieves information about your spools from the Spoolman API, excluding any archived spools. Calculates Costs for Multiple Spools: Allows you to input filament usage for multiple spools, summing up the total cost. Flexible Unit Input: Accepts filament usage in grams or meters, with units specified directly in the input (e.g., 100g, 50m). Provides a Summary Report: Displays a formatted summary of all filaments used and their individual costs at the end. You can find the script on GitHub: Spoolman Multi-Spool Cost Calculator\nHow It Works 1. Fetching Spool Data The script connects to the Spoolman API to retrieve information about your spools:\nExcludes Archived Spools: Only active spools are displayed for selection. Displays Spool Details: Shows the spool name, price, material, color, and other relevant information. 2. User Input Spool Selection: You select the spools used in your print by entering the corresponding numbers. Filament Usage: Enter the amount of filament used for each spool, directly specifying the unit (g for grams or m for meters). If you omit the unit, the script assumes grams. 3. Cost Calculation Mass per Meter Calculation: For inputs in meters, the script calculates the mass per meter using the filament's diameter and density. Cost per Gram: Calculates the cost per gram based on the spool's price and initial filament weight. Total Cost: Multiplies the filament used by the cost per gram to determine the cost for each spool, summing up the total. 4. Summary Report At the end, the script provides a summary table:\nSpool Name Filament Used Unit (g or m) Cost Setting Up the Script Prerequisites Python 3.6 or higher\nRequired Libraries: Install the necessary Python packages using:\n1pip install requests python-dotenv Configuration Clone the Repository\n1git clone https://github.com/vechiato/spoolman-multi-spool-cost-calculator.git 2cd spoolman-multi-spool-cost-calculator Set Up Environment Variables\nCreate a .env file in the project directory:\n1# Spoolman API URL (default is http://localhost:9712/api/v1 if not set) 2SPOOLMAN_API_URL=http://your-spoolman-host:port/api/v1 3 4# Spoolman API Key (if required) 5SPOOLMAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here Replace http://your-spoolman-host:port/api/v1 with your Spoolman API URL. If you don't set SPOOLMAN_API_URL, the script defaults to http://localhost:9712/api/v1.

Implementing Service Level Objectives by Alex Hidalgo provides a practical guide to adopting SLO-based approaches, allowing teams to balance user expectations and operational constraints. With its insights into SLIs (Service Level Indicators), SLOs (Service Level Objectives), and error budgets, the book helps bridge the gap between abstract goals and actionable strategies.\nI chose this book because it offers a structured way to think about reliability, a critical aspect of any service, especially in today’s complex systems. Readers can expect to gain an in-depth understanding of how to define, measure, and act upon reliability metrics while fostering a culture of continuous improvement.\n2020 by Alex Hidalgo\nSummary Part I: SLO Development Chapter 1: The Reliability Stack This chapter introduces the building blocks of reliability: SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets. Hidalgo emphasises that reliability should reflect user perception and that aiming for 100% perfection is both impractical and unnecessary. The \u0026quot;Reliability Stack\u0026quot; provides a framework for balancing reliability and innovation.\nChapter 2: How to Think About Reliability Hidalgo explores the subjective nature of reliability and how it depends on user expectations. He stresses that reliability is not about absolute perfection but about being \u0026quot;good enough\u0026quot; for your users. This chapter also introduces the importance of implied agreements between services and their users.\nChapter 3: Developing Meaningful Service Level Indicators Here, the focus shifts to SLIs, the core metrics that reflect user experience. Hidalgo discusses how to identify meaningful SLIs and align them with user needs. He also highlights the importance of keeping SLIs understandable for stakeholders.\nChapter 4: Choosing Good Service Level Objectives SLOs are targets for reliability, and this chapter explains how to set them effectively. Hidalgo warns against overcomplicating SLOs and stresses aligning them with user expectations and business goals. He also discusses challenges like setting appropriate reliability thresholds and avoiding \u0026quot;too many nines.\u0026quot;\nChapter 5: How to Use Error Budgets Error budgets quantify how much unreliability a system can tolerate within a given period. Hidalgo explains how error budgets can guide decision-making, enabling teams to balance reliability with innovation. He also explores how to incorporate error budgets into organisational processes.\nPart II: SLO Implementation Chapter 6: Getting Buy-In This chapter emphasises the importance of gaining organisational support for SLOs. Hidalgo discusses strategies for aligning stakeholders across engineering, product, and leadership teams. He also addresses common objections and how to overcome them.\nChapter 7: Measuring SLIs and SLOs Practical advice on collecting and analysing metrics takes center stage here. Hidalgo explains how to design flexible, cost-effective measurement systems while ensuring they reflect user experience accurately.\nChapter 8: SLO Monitoring and Alerting Effective alerting ensures that issues affecting user experience are addressed promptly. Hidalgo contrasts traditional threshold-based alerting with SLO-based approaches, emphasising the latter's ability to reduce noise and focus on what is important.\nChapter 9: Probability and Statistics for SLIs and SLOs This chapter dives into the math behind SLOs, including probability and statistical models. Hidalgo explains concepts like percentile thresholds and Bayesian inference, helping readers build robust measurement systems.\nChapter 10: Architecting for Reliability System architecture plays a crucial role in achieving reliability goals. Hidalgo covers strategies for designing resilient systems, including identifying dependencies, anticipating failures, and instrumenting systems for better observability.\nChapter 11: Data Reliability This chapter focuses on ensuring the reliability of data services, such as databases and storage platforms.

Hidalgo offers strategies for shifting organisational mindsets and prioritizing reliability work. He also emphasizes the iterative nature of SLOs and the importance of continuous improvement.\nChapter 14: SLO Evolution SLOs are not static. This chapter discusses how to revisit and refine SLOs as user needs, dependencies, and systems evolve. Hidalgo also covers the importance of listening to users and using failure as a learning opportunity.\nChapter 15: Discoverable and Understandable SLOs Making SLOs accessible and comprehensible to all stakeholders is critical for success. Hidalgo explores ways to document and share SLOs effectively, ensuring they are easy to discover and understand.\nChapter 16: SLO Advocacy Promoting SLO adoption within an organisation is an ongoing effort. Hidalgo provides a roadmap for advocating SLOs, from starting with pilot projects to scaling adoption across teams.\nChapter 17: Reliability Reporting The book concludes with guidance on reporting reliability metrics. Hidalgo explains how to present data in ways that drive meaningful discussions and support better decision-making.\nKey Takeaways Key Takeaway 1: Think Like a User Reliability should be measured from the perspective of the user, not internal metrics. This insight challenges traditional engineering mindsets and fosters user-centered design. Quote: “How you appear to be operating to your users is what determines whether you’re being reliable or not.” (Chapter 1, 2) Key Takeaway 2: Embrace Imperfection Perfection is costly and unnecessary. Instead, focus on being \u0026quot;good enough\u0026quot; to meet user expectations. This mindset encourages pragmatic decision-making and resource optimisation. Quote: \u0026quot;You don’t want your target to be perfect reliability, but you’ll need your service to do what it is supposed to well enough for it to be useful to your users.\u0026quot; (Chapter 1, pg 13) Key Takeaway 3: Use Error Budgets to Balance Priorities Error budgets help teams balance reliability with feature development and innovation. This approach reduces conflicts between engineering and product teams, fostering alignment. Quote: \u0026quot;If you’re out of error budget, you should take a step back and focus on making your service more reliable.\u0026quot; (Chapter 5, pg 69) Key Takeaway 4: SLOs Are a Process, Not a Project SLOs require continuous iteration and refinement as systems and user needs evolve. This aligns with the agile principle of embracing change and improving incrementally. Quote: “The world is always changing, and you should be prepared to update and change your SLIs and SLOs.” (Chapter 14, pg 309) Key Takeaway 5: Foster an SLO Culture Successful SLO adoption depends on building a culture that prioritises user experience and continuous improvement. This highlights the human element of reliability engineering, emphasizing collaboration and communication. Quote: “SLO-based approaches encourage thinking about the reliability of your services in a different and more accurate way.” (Chapter 13, pg 283) Personal Reflections Implementing Service Level Objectives fundamentally reshaped how I think about reliability. By focusing on user-centric metrics and acknowledging the inevitability of failure, the book provides a practical framework for balancing operational constraints with user satisfaction. The emphasis on culture and communication underscores that reliability is as much about people as it is about systems.\nConclusion Alex Hidalgo’s Implementing Service Level Objectives is an essential read for anyone involved in managing complex systems. With its mix of theory, practical examples, and cultural insights, the book offers a comprehensive guide to improving reliability. Whether you're an engineer, manager, or product leader, this book will help you foster better conversations, make data-driven decisions, and ultimately deliver more reliable services.\n","link":"https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-implementing-service-level-objectives/","section":"post","tags":["book","sre"],"title":"Insights from Implementing Service Level Objectives"},{"body":"How to Host Your Website for Free No Git required! if you’ve just learned HTML and CSS and are eager to put your website online, Cloudflare Pages is an excellent, beginner-friendly way to host your site for free.

If you're looking to transform your product development practices, this book is a must-read.\n2009 by Donald G. Reinertsen\nSummary Chapter 1: The Principles of Flow In this chapter, Reinertsen sets the stage by challenging the dominant paradigm of managing product development. He argues that the traditional phase-gate processes are fundamentally flawed and introduces the concept of flow-based product development. The emphasis is on small batch transfers, rapid feedback, and limited work-in-process inventory (WIP). One of the most impactful sections discusses how underground overlap of design and specification activities can lead to better outcomes, even if it goes against formal procedures.\nChapter 2: The Economic View Reinertsen dives deep into the economics of product development. He emphasises the importance of understanding the cost of delay and how it affects decision-making. The chapter introduces the project economic framework, which helps in quantifying the overall economic impact of decisions. A standout quote from this chapter is, \u0026quot;If you only quantify one thing, quantify the cost of delay.\u0026quot; (Chapter 2, Page 29). This principle underscores the critical nature of timing in product development.\nChapter 3: Managing Queues Queues are the invisible killers of productivity in product development. This chapter explains the behavior and economics of queues, and why they are crucial to manage. Reinertsen uses queueing theory to illustrate how unmanaged queues lead to long cycle times and increased variability. The chapter provides practical methods for managing and reducing queues to improve overall performance.\nChapter 4: Exploiting Variability Contrary to traditional beliefs, variability is not always the enemy. This chapter presents a new perspective on managing variability by focusing on its economic consequences. Reinertsen explains how to reduce the economic impact of variability rather than the variability itself.

It wasn’t just a quirky opinion or an eccentric idea, but a full-blown conspiracy theory. This experience piqued my interest in understanding how rational individuals could come to hold such irrational beliefs. This curiosity led me to Dan Ariely’s book, Misbelief: What Makes Rational People Believe Irrational Things. Ariely, a renowned behavioral economist, delves into the psychological underpinnings that drive people down the path of misbelief. This book offers a comprehensive look into the factors that shape our beliefs and why some individuals are more susceptible to false narratives. Readers can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the emotional, cognitive, personality, and social elements that contribute to the formation and persistence of misbeliefs.\n2023 by Dan Ariely\nSummary Part I: The Funnel of Misbelief Chapter 1: How Could That Person Believe That Thing? In this opening chapter, Ariely introduces the concept of the \u0026quot;funnel of misbelief,\u0026quot; a process by which individuals gradually shift from holding rational beliefs to adopting irrational ones. He emphasizes that this journey is not linear but influenced by various emotional, cognitive, personality, and social factors. The chapter sets the stage for exploring these elements in detail, illustrating how they intertwine to lead someone into the depths of misbelief.\nChapter 2: The Funnel at Work Ariely uses real-life examples to demonstrate how the funnel of misbelief operates. He discusses case studies of individuals who have fallen into conspiracy theories and analyzes the common patterns in their experiences. This chapter underscores the complexity of the process and the various triggers that can propel someone further down the funnel.\nPart II: The Emotional Elements and the Story of Stress Chapter 3: Pressure, Stress, Bending, and Breaking Ariely explores the role of stress as a foundational element in the development of misbeliefs. He argues that high levels of stress make individuals more vulnerable to seeking out simple explanations for their discomfort, even if these explanations are irrational. The story of Jenny, a single mom navigating the stresses of the pandemic, illustrates how personal and environmental stress can set the stage for misbelief.\nChapter 4: Picking a Villain as a Way to Regain Control This chapter delves into the human tendency to identify villains in times of crisis as a way to regain a sense of control. Ariely explains how this need for a scapegoat can drive individuals toward conspiracy theories that provide clear, albeit false, explanations for their problems.\nPart III: The Cognitive Elements and the Story of Our Dysfunctional Information-Processing Machinery Chapter 5: Our Search for the Truth We Want to Believe In Ariely examines the cognitive biases that influence our belief formation, such as confirmation bias and the tendency to seek information that supports our preexisting beliefs. He discusses how these biases can lead to the acceptance of misinformation, especially when it aligns with one's emotional needs and stress responses.\nChapter 6: Working Hard to Believe What We Already Believe This chapter focuses on the cognitive dissonance experienced when new information conflicts with existing beliefs. Ariely discusses the mental gymnastics people perform to align new information with their established narratives, reinforcing their misbeliefs rather than challenging them.\nPart IV: The Personality Elements and the Story of Our Individual Differences Chapter 7: Lessons on Personality from Alien Abductees Ariely explores how certain personality traits, such as openness to new experiences and a propensity for pattern recognition, can make individuals more susceptible to misbelief. He uses the example of people who believe in alien abductions to illustrate how personality influences the acceptance of irrational beliefs.\nChapter 8: An Attempt to Classify the Role of Personality in the Funnel of Misbelief This chapter attempts to categorize different personality types and their susceptibility to misbelief. Ariely emphasizes that while personality traits can predispose someone to misbelief, they are not deterministic. The interplay between personality and other elements is complex and nuanced.\nPart V: The Social Elements and the Story of Tribalism Chapter 9: Ostracism, Belonging, and the Social Attraction of Misbelief Ariely discusses the powerful role of social networks and community in reinforcing misbeliefs. He explains how a sense of belonging and the social currency of likes and reactions can deepen one's commitment to irrational beliefs.\nChapter 10: The Social Accelerator This chapter explores how social dynamics, including the desire for status and approval within a community of misbelievers, can accelerate the adoption and spread of misbeliefs. Ariely highlights the difficulty of escaping these social circles once entrenched (Chapter 10, p. 305).\nKey Takeaways Key Takeaway 1: Stress Stress is a critical factor in the development of misbelief. High stress levels make individuals more vulnerable to seeking out simple, often false, explanations for their discomfort. Understanding the role of stress can help in developing strategies to mitigate its impact, such as promoting mental health resources and stress management techniques. Quote: “Entrenched misbelief is the result of multiple elements coming together, every one of them adding their part to the total mix” – Dan Ariely (Chapter 3, p. 67). Key Takeaway 2: Biases Cognitive biases like confirmation bias play a significant role in shaping our beliefs. These biases lead us to seek out information that supports what we already believe, reinforcing our misbeliefs. Recognising our cognitive biases is the first step toward mitigating their influence. Critical thinking and skepticism can help counteract these biases. Quote: “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you into trouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so” – Mark Twain (Chapter 5, p. 123). Key Takeaway 3: Social dynamics Social dynamics and the need for belonging can significantly reinforce misbeliefs. Social networks provide a community and a sense of identity that make it difficult for individuals to abandon their irrational beliefs. Building inclusive and supportive communities that promote critical thinking can help reduce the appeal of misbelief-centric social circles. Quote: “The social elements are the components that ‘seal the deal’ and make it exceedingly hard to escape” – Dan Ariely (Chapter 9, p. 277). Personal Reflections Misbelief offers profound insights into the psychological processes that lead rational individuals to embrace irrational beliefs. The book has shifted my perspective on how stress, cognitive biases, personality traits, and social dynamics interact to shape our beliefs. It has made me more aware of the importance of fostering critical thinking and supportive communities to combat the spread of misinformation.\nConclusion Dan Ariely’s Misbelief is an essential read for anyone interested in understanding the psychological underpinnings of irrational beliefs. The book provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing how various elements contribute to the formation and persistence of misbeliefs. Ariely’s engaging writing and real-life examples make complex psychological concepts accessible and relatable. I highly recommend this book to anyone seeking to understand and address the roots of irrational beliefs in today’s society.\n","link":"https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-misbelif/","section":"post","tags":["book"],"title":"Insights from Misbelief"},{"body":"Falco Enhances Container Security with Real-time Threat Detection In today's digital landscape, containerised applications have become the cornerstone of modern software development, offering scalability, portability, and efficiency. However, with the proliferation of containers, security concerns have also escalated. Ensuring the security of containerized environments is paramount to safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of applications.

Insights from the Hard Disk Drive Industry Christensen begins by examining the hard disk drive industry, a field characterised by rapid technological changes. He introduces the concept of disruptive technologies—innovations that initially offer lower performance but eventually surpass existing technologies. Established firms often fail because they focus on sustaining technologies that improve existing products for their current customers.\nChapter 2: Value Networks and the Impetus to Innovate Value networks define the context within which a firm identifies and responds to customers' needs, solves problems, procures input, reacts to competitors, and strives for profit. Companies operate within their existing value networks, which makes it challenging to adopt disruptive technologies that fall outside these networks.\nChapter 3: Disruptive Technological Change in the Mechanical Excavator Industry The mechanical excavator industry provides another example where leading firms were overtaken by newcomers employing disruptive technologies. Christensen emphasises that disruptive innovations often appear less profitable initially, which is why established firms are reluctant to invest in them.\nChapter 4: What Goes Up, Can’t Go Down This chapter discusses the limits of sustaining technologies and how companies' focus on high-end customers often leads to over-engineering, which opens the door for simpler, more affordable disruptive technologies to capture the low end of the market and gradually move up.\nPart Two: Managing Disruptive Technological Change Chapter 5: Give Responsibility for Disruptive Technologies to Organisations Whose Customers Need Them Christensen argues that successful companies should create autonomous organisations to develop disruptive technologies. These new units can operate independently and are free from the constraints and biases of the parent company.\nChapter 6: Match the Size of the Organization to the Size of the Market Large companies struggle to invest in small, emerging markets. By creating smaller, focused organizations, companies can better address these new markets' needs and grow alongside them.\nChapter 7: Discovering New and Emerging Markets Established firms often fail to recognise and enter new markets early. Christensen suggests that companies should embrace uncertainty and adopt a discovery-driven planning approach, which allows for flexibility and learning.\nChapter 8: How to Appraise Your Organisation’s Capabilities and Disabilities Organisations have inherent capabilities and disabilities based on their existing processes and values. Christensen advises managers to assess these attributes to determine whether their organisation is suited to tackle new disruptive challenges.\nChapter 9: Performance Provided, Market Demand, and the Product Life Cycle Technological progress can outstrip market demand, leading to a mismatch between what companies can produce and what customers actually need. This chapter explores how companies can anticipate and adapt to these shifts.\nChapter 10: Managing Disruptive Technological Change: A Case Study Christensen provides a detailed case study on the electric vehicle industry, illustrating how companies can strategically manage disruptive technologies by aligning their organisation and resources with the unique demands of these emerging markets.\nChapter 11: The Dilemmas of Innovation: A Summary The final chapter summarizes the principles of disruptive innovation and emphasises the importance of understanding when to follow conventional management practices and when to deviate from them to embrace disruptive changes.\nKey Takeaways Disruptive vs. Sustaining Technologies: Disruptive technologies initially underperform compared to existing products but eventually capture mainstream markets. Value Networks: Companies operate within value networks that define their business models and customer relationships, making it difficult to adopt disruptive technologies. Autonomous Organisations: Creating independent units to explore disruptive technologies can help established firms innovate without being constrained by their existing processes and values. Small Market Entry: Large companies should create smaller, focused units to enter and grow with emerging markets.

It can help detect damaged or faulty sectors that may affect the reliability of the disk and the data stored on it.\nHow it works: The badblocks command scans a disk for bad sectors by writing test patterns (usually zeros or ones) to the disk and then reading them back. If the data cannot be read correctly after being written, the sector is considered \u0026quot;bad.\u0026quot; The command then reports the location of these bad sectors.\nSyntax: 1badblocks [options] \u0026lt;device\u0026gt; Where \u0026lt;device\u0026gt; is the path to the disk, e.g., /dev/sdb.\nCommon Options: -v: Verbose mode; provides more detailed output. -n: Non-destructive read-write test. This option writes test patterns to the disk but does not overwrite your data. -s: Shows the progress of the test. -w: Performs a destructive write-test, which writes to every block on the disk to check for errors. This will overwrite any data on the disk. -l \u0026lt;file\u0026gt;: Outputs a list of bad blocks to the specified file. -b \u0026lt;block_size\u0026gt;: Specifies the block size (in bytes) to use during testing. -p \u0026lt;passes\u0026gt;: Specifies the number of passes to make during testing. -f: Forces badblock detection even if the disk is already in use (dangerous in some cases). Example Usage: Check for bad blocks (non-destructive): 1badblocks -n -v /dev/sdb Destructive write test: 1badblocks -w -v /dev/sdb This command will write test patterns to the entire disk and check for bad sectors, but it will overwrite all data on the disk.\nImportant Notes: Destructive Testing: The -w option overwrites all data on the disk, so it is recommended to back up any important data before using this option. Time-Consuming: Running badblocks can take a long time, especially on large disks, because it reads and writes to every block of the device. Not Always Accurate: While badblocks is a useful tool, it doesn't always catch all possible hardware failures, and it may not detect all types of issues, such as wear on an SSD. SMART Monitoring: For more advanced disk health monitoring, it's also a good idea to use tools like smartctl (part of the smartmontools package) to check the SMART status of the drive. Use Cases: Preventive Maintenance: Running badblocks periodically can help detect failing drives early, potentially avoiding data loss. After Data Recovery: If you've recovered data from a damaged disk, running badblocks can help identify additional issues before using the disk again. Drive Health Assessment: For drives showing signs of failure (slow performance, errors), badblocks can help pinpoint the extent of damage. In summary, badblocks is a helpful tool for identifying bad sectors and assessing the health of a storage device, but care must be taken when using it, especially with destructive options.\n","link":"https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/badblocks/","section":"post","tags":["linux"],"title":"Search and identify bad sectors on a storage device using badblocks"},{"body":"Continuous Delivery Continuous Delivery (CD) has revolutionised the way software is developed and deployed, aiming to make software releases a reliable, predictable process.
