&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09ZJ1NZRB">End-to-End Automation with Kubernetes and Crossplane: Develop a control plane-based platform for unified infrastructure, services, and application automation&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes has emerged as a dominant force, revolutionising the way organisations deploy and manage applications. However, the complexity of infrastructure automation has often been a bottleneck. Enter Crossplane—a powerful extension of Kubernetes designed to bring the same level of automation to infrastructure provisioning and management. In &amp;quot;End-to-End Automation with Kubernetes and Crossplane,&amp;quot; Arun Ramakani guides us through building a control plane-based platform for unified infrastructure, services, and application automation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Insights from Learning Helm: Managing Apps on Kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-learning-helm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-learning-helm/</guid><description>
&lt;h1 id="learning-helm-managing-apps-on-kubernetes">&lt;strong>Learning Helm: Managing Apps on Kubernetes&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I remember the first time I dived into Kubernetes; it felt like stepping into a new world. There were so many moving parts, and I quickly realised the need for effective tools to manage it all. This is where &amp;quot;Learning Helm&amp;quot; by Matt Butcher, Matt Farina, and Josh Dolitsky comes in. The book serves as a comprehensive guide to using Helm, the package manager for Kubernetes. I chose helm because it promised to simplify the complexity of Kubernetes management, and it certainly delivered. Readers can expect to gain a solid understanding of Helm's capabilities, its architecture, and practical ways to manage Kubernetes applications efficiently.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
