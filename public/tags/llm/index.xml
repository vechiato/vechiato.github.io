&lt;p>A few years ago, I found myself increasingly drawn into the world of AI engineering, especially with the rise of foundation models like GPT, BERT, and Stable Diffusion. These models were no longer just research curiosities they were powering real-world applications at an unprecedented scale. When I came across &lt;em>AI Engineering: Building Applications with Foundation Models&lt;/em> by Chip Huyen, I knew it was a must-read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The book provides a structured, practical guide to building AI applications using foundation models. It’s not about developing new AI models from scratch but about leveraging existing ones effectively. Whether you’re an engineer, a product manager, or a technical leader, the book offers insights into planning, deploying, and maintaining AI systems in production.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Install and Run DeepSeek R1 and DeepSeek Coder Models Using Ollama</title><link>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/deepseek-r1-homelab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/deepseek-r1-homelab/</guid><description>
