&lt;h1 id="crossplane-the-cloud-native-control-plane">&lt;strong>Crossplane: The Cloud Native Control Plane&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As a Platform Engineering enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by the potential of cloud-native technologies to streamline and enhance our workflows. Recently, I picked up &amp;quot;Crossplane: The Cloud Native Control Plane&amp;quot; by Viktor Farcic, and it has been an enlightening journey. This book delves into the intricacies of Crossplane, a project that democratizes the powerful capabilities traditionally reserved for major cloud providers. By abstracting away complexity and allowing for custom control planes, Crossplane stands out as a transformative tool for modern infrastructure management. I chose this book to deepen my understanding of how Crossplane can help create a seamless, scalable, and efficient cloud infrastructure tailored to specific organizational needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Insights from Platform Engineering on Kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-platform-engineering-on-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-platform-engineering-on-kubernetes/</guid><description>

&lt;p>In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes has emerged as a dominant force, revolutionising the way organisations deploy and manage applications. However, the complexity of infrastructure automation has often been a bottleneck. Enter Crossplane—a powerful extension of Kubernetes designed to bring the same level of automation to infrastructure provisioning and management. In &amp;quot;End-to-End Automation with Kubernetes and Crossplane,&amp;quot; Arun Ramakani guides us through building a control plane-based platform for unified infrastructure, services, and application automation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
