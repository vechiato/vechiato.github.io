      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the realm of cloud-native infrastructure, eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) has emerged as a revolutionary technology. By allowing developers to write custom code that dynamically changes kernel behavior, eBPF has paved the way for a new generation of security, observability, and networking tools. In &amp;quot;Learning eBPF: Programming the Linux Kernel for Enhanced Observability, Networking, and Security,&amp;quot; Liz Rice provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing eBPF. This book is essential for developers, system administrators, operators, and students who seek to harness the power of eBPF.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
