      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I found myself in a team where decision-making felt chaotic. There were no managers, just “owners” of tasks and projects. It felt empowering until it didn’t. Deadlines slipped, no one seemed accountable, and team members quietly longed for someone to just decide. That experience made me curious: is flat really better?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That’s what drew me to Markus Reitzig’s &lt;em&gt;Get Better at Flatter&lt;/em&gt;. This book isn’t another feel-good endorsement of boss-less organizations. Instead, it’s a science-based, experience-driven guide on how and when flat structures work and when they don’t. Reitzig gives leaders a realistic, actionable framework for shaping less hierarchical organizations that can actually deliver results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I began managing engineers, I quickly realized that success wasn&#39;t just about solving technical problems it was about designing systems, enabling people, and managing complexity at scale. But with every new challenge, I felt like I was piecing together a puzzle with missing corners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Will Larson’s &lt;em&gt;An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management&lt;/em&gt; offers more than advice it provides a systems-thinking approach to organizational design, career development, and technical leadership. It became my go-to manual not because it had all the answers, but because it gave me better questions. If you’re an engineering leader or aspiring to be one this book delivers deeply practical tools for tackling the human and structural challenges that come with scale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Eduardo&#39;s recommendation was timely as I sought to understand how remote work could be effectively implemented and its impact on workplace culture and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
