&lt;h1 id="intro-to-python-programming-beginners-guide-series">&lt;strong>Intro To Python Programming: Beginners Guide Series&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As a parent and mentor, I’m always on the lookout for resources to inspire and educate young minds. My son recently expressed an interest in learning Python, and I also help kids at a coding club take their first steps into programming. These two motivations led me to John Elder’s &lt;em>Intro to Python Programming&lt;/em>. This book promises to make coding approachable and fun for beginners, which aligns perfectly with my goals. Elder’s conversational tone and hands-on approach provide an excellent foundation for young learners and anyone embarking on their coding journey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Code Club - Quiz Controlled LEDs</title><link>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/code-club---quiz-controlled-leds-with-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/code-club---quiz-controlled-leds-with-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>
&lt;h1 id="quiz-controlled-leds-with-raspberry-pi">&lt;strong>Quiz Controlled LEDs with Raspberry Pi&lt;/strong>&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Here's a challenge design for someone learning Python with a Raspberry Pi that incorporates asking questions and controlling LEDs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="objective">&lt;strong>Objective:&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Create a Python-based LED game where players answer questions. Correct answers turn on a green LED, while wrong answers flash a red LED multiple times.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="code_club_thumbjpeg">![[code_club_thumb.jpeg]]&lt;/h2>
&lt;h2 id="requirements">&lt;strong>Requirements:&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="hardware">&lt;strong>Hardware:&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi (with GPIO capabilities)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 green LED for correct answers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 red LED for incorrect answers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 330Ω resistors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Breadboard and jumper wires&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="python-concepts">&lt;strong>Python Concepts:&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;code>if&lt;/code>/&lt;code>else&lt;/code> statements&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Loops&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Functions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Basic GPIO control&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="challenge-overview">&lt;strong>Challenge Overview:&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="game-rules">Game Rules:&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The game asks 5 multiple-choice questions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Players respond by entering the correct letter (e.g., A, B, C).
If the answer is correct:
The green LED lights up for 1 second.
The player gets a congratulatory message.
If the answer is incorrect:
The red LED flashes 3 times.
A message tells the player the correct answer.
The game ends with a score summary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="steps">&lt;strong>Steps:&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;h4 id="1-setup-the-leds">1. &lt;strong>Setup the LEDs&lt;/strong>:&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Connect the LEDs to two GPIO pins (e.g., GPIO17 and GPIO18).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use resistors to protect the LEDs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Connect the cathode (short leg) of each LED to the ground (negative -).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
