&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a DevOps enthusiast, I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the potential of cloud-native technologies to streamline and enhance our workflows. Recently, I picked up &amp;ldquo;Crossplane: The Cloud Native Control Plane&amp;rdquo; by Viktor Farcic, and it has been an enlightening journey. This book delves into the intricacies of Crossplane, a project that democratizes the powerful capabilities traditionally reserved for major cloud providers. By abstracting away complexity and allowing for custom control planes, Crossplane stands out as a transformative tool for modern infrastructure management. I chose this book to deepen my understanding of how Crossplane can help create a seamless, scalable, and efficient cloud infrastructure tailored to specific organizational needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;chapter-1-the-rise-of-platforms-on-top-of-kubernetes&#34;&gt;Chapter 1: The Rise of Platforms on Top of Kubernetes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This chapter introduces the concept of platforms and their significance. It explains why platforms are essential for organisations and discusses the advantages of building platforms on top of Kubernetes. The chapter also outlines the challenges associated with platform engineering and the need for a &amp;ldquo;walking skeleton&amp;rdquo; to demonstrate platform concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09ZJ1NZRB&#34;&gt;End-to-End Automation with Kubernetes and Crossplane: Develop a control plane-based platform for unified infrastructure, services, and application automation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes has emerged as a dominant force, revolutionizing the way organizations deploy and manage applications. However, the complexity of infrastructure automation has often been a bottleneck. Enter Crossplaneâ€”a powerful extension of Kubernetes designed to bring the same level of automation to infrastructure provisioning and management. In &amp;ldquo;End-to-End Automation with Kubernetes and Crossplane,&amp;rdquo; Arun Ramakani guides us through building a control plane-based platform for unified infrastructure, services, and application automation.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently had the wonderful opportunity to present at the London SRE Meetup, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share the experience with you all. The presentation, titled &amp;ldquo;Working Together: SRE and Platform Engineering,&amp;rdquo; focused on the synergy between site reliability engineering and platform engineering to enhance operational efficiencies and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to have engaged with so many knowledgeable professionals and enthusiasts who are passionate about improving systems and operations. The discussions and interactions were enlightening, and I hope they were as beneficial for attendees as they were for me.&lt;/p&gt;
