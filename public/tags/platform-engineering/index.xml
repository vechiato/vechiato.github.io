            I recently had the wonderful opportunity to present at the London SRE Meetup, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share the experience with you all. The presentation, titled &amp;ldquo;Working Together: SRE and Platform Engineering,&amp;rdquo; focused on the synergy between site reliability engineering and platform engineering to enhance operational efficiencies and reliability.
I am pleased to have engaged with so many knowledgeable professionals and enthusiasts who are passionate about improving systems and operations.
