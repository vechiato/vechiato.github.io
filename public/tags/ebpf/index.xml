      <description>ðŸš€ Just finished reading my autographed copy of â€œeBPF: Programmatically Extend the Linux Kernel&amp;quot; and I&amp;rsquo;m absolutely blown away by the possibilities it offers! If you&amp;rsquo;re working with Linux, containers, observability or security, this book is a must-read.&#xA;eBPF allows you to run sandboxed programs in the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules. The applications for network performance monitoring, security, and system observability are incredible.</description>

      <description>Falco Enhances Container Security with Real-time Threat Detection In today&amp;rsquo;s digital landscape, containerised applications have become the cornerstone of modern software development, offering scalability, portability, and efficiency. However, with the proliferation of containers, security concerns have also escalated. Ensuring the security of containerized environments is paramount to safeguarding sensitive data and maintaining the integrity of applications. To address these challenges, the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has introduced Falco, an open-source runtime security project designed to provide real-time threat detection for containers and Kubernetes environments.</description>
