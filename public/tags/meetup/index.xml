            &lt;p&gt;I recently had the wonderful opportunity to present at the London SRE Meetup, and I&#39;m excited to share the experience with you all. The presentation, titled &amp;quot;Working Together: SRE and Platform Engineering,&amp;quot; focused on the synergy between site reliability engineering and platform engineering to enhance operational efficiencies and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to have engaged with so many knowledgeable professionals and enthusiasts who are passionate about improving systems and operations. The discussions and interactions were enlightening, and I hope they were as beneficial for attendees as they were for me.&lt;/p&gt;
