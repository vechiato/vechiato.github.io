&lt;h1 id=&#34;chaos-engineering-system-resiliency-in-practice&#34;&gt;Chaos Engineering: System Resiliency in Practice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember multiple occasions when systems were not down but badly impacted during major events. The scramble to restore service and the subsequent post-mortem meeting highlighted our lack of preparedness for unexpected system failures. The book begins with the history of Chaos Engineering, originating from Netflix. Rosenthal and Jones describe the transition from datacenter architecture to cloud infrastructure, highlighting challenges and the necessity of Chaos Engineering for improving system resiliency. This book delves into the principles and practices of Chaos Engineering, a methodology designed to improve system reliability by intentionally introducing failures. I chose this book to understand how we can better prepare for the unexpected and ensure our systems can withstand and recover from disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1098135121&#34;&gt;Learning eBPF: Programming the Linux Kernel for Enhanced Observability, Networking, and Security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;learning-ebpf&#34;&gt;Learning eBPF&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the realm of cloud-native infrastructure, eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) has emerged as a revolutionary technology. By allowing developers to write custom code that dynamically changes kernel behavior, eBPF has paved the way for a new generation of security, observability, and networking tools. In &amp;ldquo;Learning eBPF: Programming the Linux Kernel for Enhanced Observability, Networking, and Security,&amp;rdquo; Liz Rice provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and utilizing eBPF. This book is essential for developers, system administrators, operators, and students who seek to harness the power of eBPF.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently had the wonderful opportunity to present at the London SRE Meetup, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to share the experience with you all. The presentation, titled &amp;ldquo;Working Together: SRE and Platform Engineering,&amp;rdquo; focused on the synergy between site reliability engineering and platform engineering to enhance operational efficiencies and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to have engaged with so many knowledgeable professionals and enthusiasts who are passionate about improving systems and operations. The discussions and interactions were enlightening, and I hope they were as beneficial for attendees as they were for me.&lt;/p&gt;
