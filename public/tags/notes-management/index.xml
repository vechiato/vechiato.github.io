&lt;h3 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I found myself overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information I was trying to manage daily. Articles, books, emails, and notes piled up, creating a chaotic mental space that hindered my productivity and creativity. When I came across Tiago Forteâ€™s &lt;em&gt;Building a Second Brain&lt;/em&gt;, it felt like a lifeline. This book promises to help readers organize their digital lives and unlock their creative potential through a methodical approach to personal knowledge management. Intrigued by the idea of creating a digital system to support my thinking and memory, I dived in. This book offers a structured method to capture, organize, distill, and express information, ultimately transforming how we interact with and leverage our knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
