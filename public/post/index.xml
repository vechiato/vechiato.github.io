&lt;p>As a 3D printing enthusiast, I've often grappled with accurately calculating the cost of my prints. While slicers provide estimates of filament usage, they don't account for the actual cost of the filament used, especially when dealing with multiple spools or varying filament prices. To solve this, I developed a Python script that calculates the real cost of a 3D print by leveraging the Spoolman API.
In this blog post, I'll walk you through the motivation behind the project, the features of the script, and how you can use it to accurately estimate your 3D printing costs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Insights from Mastering OpenTelemetry and Observability</title><link>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-mastering-opentelemetry-and-observability/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.vechiato.cc/post/book-mastering-opentelemetry-and-observability/</guid><description>

&lt;p>The &lt;code>badblocks&lt;/code> command in Linux is used to search for and identify bad sectors on a storage device, such as a hard drive or solid-state drive. It can help detect damaged or faulty sectors that may affect the reliability of the disk and the data stored on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-it-works">How it works:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;code>badblocks&lt;/code> command scans a disk for bad sectors by writing test patterns (usually zeros or ones) to the disk and then reading them back.
