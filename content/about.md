Hi, I’m Marcus, an experienced engineering leader with a passion for building scalable, reliable platforms. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working with diverse teams to solve complex infrastructure challenges, helping businesses deliver impactful products at scale. My journey in tech has taken me from hands-on development to leading teams in DevOps and Infrastructure Engineering.

I also volunteer at a **Code Club** for young children, where most are having their first experience with coding. We introduce them to programming through tools like **Scratch**, beginner-friendly **HTML & CSS** and **Python** projects. It’s rewarding to help foster curiosity and creativity in the next generation of tech enthusiasts.

Outside of work, I’m always tinkering with **IoT projects**, using tools like **Home Assistant**, **Arduino**, and **ESPs**. I’m also experimenting with **3D printing**, adding a new layer of creativity to my projects. When I’m not coding or building, I love spending time with my family and exploring the latest trends in technology.

This blog is a space for me to share insights on **books**, **leadership**, **technology**, and my **personal projects**. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something here that sparks your interest!
