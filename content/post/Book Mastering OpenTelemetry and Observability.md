## **Summary**

### **Chapter 1: What Is Observability?**

This introductory chapter defines observability and explains its significance in the cloud-native era. It contrasts observability with traditional monitoring, emphasizing that while monitoring handles predefined scenarios, observability helps tackle the unknown. Key concepts like dimensionality, cardinality, and semantic conventions are introduced, highlighting their roles in telemetry data analysis.

Quote: "Observability is about making systems understandable through the data they emit." – Steve Flanders (Page 5)

### **Chapter 2: Introducing OpenTelemetry!**

The chapter discusses the evolution of open-source observability tools and introduces OpenTelemetry as a unified standard. It explains how OpenTelemetry simplifies data collection through its components: APIs, SDKs, and collectors. Readers also get a glimpse of the roadmap for OpenTelemetry's continued development.
