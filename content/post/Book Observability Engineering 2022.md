### **Part I: The Path to Observability**

#### **Chapter 1: What Is Observability?**
The first chapter sets the stage by defining observability and its importance in modern software systems. The authors discuss the limitations of traditional monitoring and how observability provides deeper insights into system performance and issues.

#### **Chapter 2: How Debugging Practices Differ Between Observability and Monitoring**
This chapter explains the differences in debugging practices using observability versus traditional monitoring. The authors highlight how observability enables proactive and effective debugging compared to the reactive nature of traditional monitoring.

#### **Chapter 3: Lessons from Scaling Without Observability**
The authors share lessons learned from scaling systems without observability. This chapter provides a historical perspective on how modern practices evolved and the challenges faced during the transition to observability.

#### **Chapter 4: How Observability Relates to DevOps, SRE, and Cloud Native**
This chapter discusses the relationship between observability, DevOps, SRE, and cloud-native practices. It explains how observability empowers these practices and contributes to system reliability and efficiency.

### **Part II: Fundamentals of Observability**

#### **Chapter 5: Structured Events Are the Building Blocks of Observability**
The authors delve into the concept of structured events and their significance in achieving observability. They explain how structured events provide detailed context and enhance debugging capabilities compared to traditional logs and metrics.

#### **Chapter 6: Stitching Events into Traces**
This chapter focuses on distributed tracing and its components. The authors explain how to instrument traces and stitch events into comprehensive traces to understand system behavior across services.

#### **Chapter 7: Instrumentation with OpenTelemetry**
The authors introduce OpenTelemetry, a set of open standards for instrumentation. This chapter provides practical guidance on using OpenTelemetry for automatic and custom instrumentation to collect telemetry data.

#### **Chapter 8: Analyzing Events to Achieve Observability**
This chapter covers techniques for analyzing events to achieve observability. The authors discuss the core analysis loop, debugging from known conditions and first principles, and automating the brute-force portion of the analysis.

#### **Chapter 9: How Observability and Monitoring Come Together**
The authors explain the complementary roles of observability and monitoring. This chapter provides real-world examples of how these practices work together to enhance system reliability.

### **Part III: Observability for Teams**

#### **Chapter 10: Applying Observability Practices in Your Team**
This chapter offers practical advice on integrating observability practices within a team. The authors discuss joining community groups, addressing pain points, iterative instrumentation, and leveraging existing efforts.

#### **Chapter 11: Observability-Driven Development**
The authors introduce observability-driven development, explaining how to incorporate observability into the development cycle. This chapter covers test-driven development, debugging in microservices, and shifting observability left to speed up software delivery.

#### **Chapter 12: Using Service-Level Objectives for Reliability**
This chapter explores the use of service-level objectives (SLOs) for reliable alerting. The authors discuss how traditional monitoring approaches can lead to alert fatigue and how SLO-based alerts improve reliability and user experience.

#### **Chapter 13: Acting on and Debugging SLO-Based Alerts**
The authors provide strategies for acting on and debugging SLO-based alerts. This chapter explains how to forecast and create predictive burn alerts, frame time as a sliding window, and use observability data for effective alerting.

#### **Chapter 14: Observability and the Software Supply Chain**
This chapter focuses on the role of observability in the software supply chain. The authors provide case studies and practical advice on operationalizing observability to understand context and embed actionable alerting.

### **Part IV: Observability at Scale**

#### **Chapter 15: Build Versus Buy and Return on Investment**
The authors discuss the considerations for building versus buying observability solutions. This chapter provides a detailed analysis of the costs, benefits, and risks associated with both approaches, helping organizations make informed decisions.

#### **Chapter 16: Managing a Telemetry Pipeline**
This chapter provides insights into managing a telemetry pipeline, covering aspects such as capacity management, data quality, rate limiting, and security. The authors share practical advice on building and maintaining a robust telemetry pipeline.

### **Part V: Spreading Observability Culture**

#### **Chapter 17: The Business Case for Observability**
The authors make a compelling business case for observability, discussing its return on investment (ROI) and how to introduce observability as a practice within an organisation.

#### **Chapter 18: Observability's Stakeholders and Allies**
This chapter identifies the various stakeholders and allies in the observability journey. The authors provide strategies for engaging non-engineering teams, such as customer support and sales, to promote a culture of observability.

#### **Chapter 19: An Observability Maturity Model**
The authors introduce an Observability Maturity Model (OMM) to help organizations assess their observability capabilities and plan for continuous improvement. This chapter outlines the capabilities referenced in the OMM and provides guidance on using the model effectively.

#### **Chapter 20: Where to Go from Here**
The final chapter provides predictions for the future of observability and additional resources for readers. The authors emphasize the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and practices in observability.
