### **Part 1: Introducing Database Reliability Engineering**

#### **Chapter 1: Introducing Database Reliability Engineering**

This chapter sets the stage by defining the role of a Database Reliability Engineer and the need for reliability engineering in database management. It discusses the transition from traditional database administration to a more integrated and automated approach that aligns with DevOps principles.

#### **Chapter 2: Service-Level Management**

Service-level objectives (SLOs) and indicators (SLIs) are crucial for managing the performance and reliability of databases. This chapter explains how to define, monitor, and report on various service-level metrics such as latency, availability, throughput, and durability.

#### **Chapter 3: Risk Management**

Risk management is about identifying and mitigating potential issues that could affect database reliability. The chapter covers risk considerations, bootstrapping processes, service risk evaluation, architectural inventory, and prioritisation strategies.

### **Part 2: Operational Visibility**

#### **Chapter 4: Operational Visibility**

Operational visibility involves monitoring and understanding the performance and health of database systems. This chapter introduces frameworks for telemetry, metrics, logs, and events, and discusses the importance of distributed tracing and internal database visibility.

#### **Chapter 5: Infrastructure Engineering**

The chapter delves into the various aspects of infrastructure engineering, including the use of physical servers, virtualisation, containers, and Database as a Service (DBaaS). It discusses the benefits and challenges of each approach and their implications for database reliability.

### **Part 3: Infrastructure Management**

#### **Chapter 6: Infrastructure Management**

Effective infrastructure management requires robust configuration management, version control, orchestration, and compliance testing. This chapter outlines best practices for maintaining and enforcing infrastructure configurations and integrating them into development environments.

#### **Chapter 7: Backup and Recovery**

Backup and recovery are critical components of database reliability. This chapter explains different backup strategies, recovery scenarios, and the essential building blocks of a robust recovery strategy, including detection, tiered storage, varied tools, and thorough testing.

### **Part 4: Advanced Topics**

#### **Chapter 8: Release Management**

Managing releases in a database environment involves creating safety nets to reduce risks and facilitate smooth deployments. This chapter discusses strategies for release management and how to balance innovation with reliability.

#### **Chapter 9: Security**

Data security is paramount for protecting sensitive information and ensuring compliance. This chapter covers strategies for planning and managing database security in evolving infrastructures.

#### **Chapter 10: Data Storage, Indexing, and Replication**

The chapter explores various data storage techniques, indexing methods, and replication topologies. It compares relational databases with other data storage models like sorted strings and log-structured merge trees.

#### **Chapter 11: Datastore Field Guide**

A comprehensive guide to evaluating and operating different datastores, this chapter highlights the conceptual and internal attributes essential for application developers and architects.

#### **Chapter 12: Architectural Patterns for Distributed Databases**

This chapter examines common architectural patterns used in distributed databases and the pipelines involved. It provides insights into the components and complexities of a database ecosystem.

#### **Chapter 13: Building a Culture of Database Reliability Engineering**

The final chapter discusses how to foster a culture of reliability within an organisation. It emphasises the transformation of the DBRE role from administrator to engineer and the importance of collaboration and continuous improvement.
