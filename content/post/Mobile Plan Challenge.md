Hey Code Club! Want to use your coding and research skills to help your family **save real money**? Here’s a fun challenge for you (and yes, you can earn a reward too)!

---

## 🧩 The Problem

Our family pays **way too much** for our phone plans! Here’s what we have right now:

- **3 SIM cards with 10GB of data each**: £67/month  
- **1 SIM card with 20GB of data**: £10/month  
- **TOTAL:** £77/month for 4 phones!

But I know there are **cheaper deals out there** with more data.

## 🚀 Challenge: Be the Smart Shopper!

**Your Mission:** Help your family find a better deal!

**Here are the rules:**
- Find a mobile (phone) plan with **4 SIM cards**
- **Each SIM must have at least 20GB of data per month**
- The **new total must cost less than £77 per month**
- You have up to **4 weeks** to do it & present your findings

## 💰 Prizes: How You Can Earn

If you find a better deal and explain it to your family, **you’ll earn some of the money you save each month**. The better your project, the longer you get paid!

| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Level 1: Simple Facts            | Write or say what you found (& how much we’d save)                                          | 1 month of 50% of the savings |
| Level 2: Comparison Presentation | Make a table/chart to compare old vs new plans                                              | 2 months of 50% savings       |
| Level 3: Build a Simple Website  | Make a website with a comparison table, logos and your choice                               | 4 months of 50% savings       |
| Level 4: Website + Python Script | Also code a Python script to compare the old plan with the new plans and show the best deal | 6 months of 50% savings       |
