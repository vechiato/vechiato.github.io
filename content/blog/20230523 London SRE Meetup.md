I recently had the wonderful opportunity to present at the London SRE Meetup, and I'm excited to share the experience with you all. The presentation, titled "Working Together: SRE and Platform Engineering," focused on the synergy between site reliability engineering and platform engineering to enhance operational efficiencies and reliability.

I am pleased to have engaged with so many knowledgeable professionals and enthusiasts who are passionate about improving systems and operations. The discussions and interactions were enlightening, and I hope they were as beneficial for attendees as they were for me.

For those who could not attend or would like to revisit the topics discussed, I've included the slides from my presentation. You can view them here: [Working Together: SRE and Platform Engineering](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/working-together-sre-platform-engineering/268598286).
