[End-to-End Automation with Kubernetes and Crossplane: Develop a control plane-based platform for unified infrastructure, services, and application automation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09ZJ1NZRB)
## Introduction

In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud-native infrastructure, Kubernetes has emerged as a dominant force, revolutionizing the way organizations deploy and manage applications. However, the complexity of infrastructure automation has often been a bottleneck. Enter Crossplaneâ€”a powerful extension of Kubernetes designed to bring the same level of automation to infrastructure provisioning and management. In "End-to-End Automation with Kubernetes and Crossplane," Arun Ramakani guides us through building a control plane-based platform for unified infrastructure, services, and application automation.

## Overview

This book is an essential read for cloud architects, platform engineers, infrastructure operators, and Kubernetes enthusiasts. Arun Ramakani expertly navigates the intricate world of infrastructure automation, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of Crossplane and its integration with Kubernetes.

## Key Concepts

1. **Understanding Kubernetes-Based Infrastructure Automation:**
   - The book starts by contextualizing Kubernetes-based infrastructure automation, highlighting its advantages and the disruptive potential it holds for IT operations.

2. **Crossplane Fundamentals:**
   - Readers are introduced to the core concepts of Crossplane, including Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and custom controllers. These building blocks are crucial for extending Kubernetes to manage external infrastructure resources effectively.

3. **Practical Examples and Hands-On Modules:**
   - Arun provides practical examples and hands-on modules using popular configuration management tools such as Helm, Kustomize, CNAB, Argo, Keptn, and Open Policy Agent. These examples are designed to be directly applicable in real-world scenarios, making it easier for practitioners to implement what they learn.
