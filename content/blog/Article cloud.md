I found it fascinating to see mainstream media like the BBC discussing companies moving away from cloud services.

This well-known discussion from tech media several months ago has now reached mainstream coverage. The BBC article on 37signals moving away from the cloud to save costs highlights the complexity of the decision. While I'm not against cloud computing, it's important to see how businesses are evaluating what works best for them. If your systems were not born in the cloud, how you tackle your cloud journey will drive your future. European companies still running 85% of their workloads on-prem. 

It's crucial to determine the best approach for your company and systems in the short, medium, and long term, ensuring it aligns with your business perspective and goals. Assess your team's skills and decide whether to partner for the heavy lifting and then train your team for ongoing management. It needs to be a well-structured decision, not just because everyone else is doing it. This mirrors the monolith vs. microservices debate, but that's a topic for another day.

Worth a reflection!
