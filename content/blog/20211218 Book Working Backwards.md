# Working Backwards

## Introduction

"Working Backwards: Insights, Stories, and Secrets from Inside Amazon" by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr offers an insider’s perspective on the unique principles and processes that have driven Amazon's success. The authors, both former Amazon executives, provide a detailed account of how the company's culture and methodologies can be applied to achieve extraordinary results in any organisation.

## Summary

### Part One: Being Amazonian

#### Chapter 1: Building Blocks: Leadership Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter introduces Amazon's 14 Leadership Principles, which are central to the company's culture and decision-making processes. The principles include Customer Obsession, Ownership, Invent and Simplify, and Bias for Action, among others. The authors explain how these principles are not just corporate slogans but are deeply embedded in every aspect of Amazon's operations.

#### Chapter 2: Hiring: Amazon’s Unique Bar Raiser Process

Amazon’s Bar Raiser hiring process is designed to maintain high standards by involving experienced employees in the interview process to ensure new hires meet or exceed current performance levels. This chapter details the rigorous process and its impact on maintaining a high-performance culture.

#### Chapter 3: Organizing: Separable, Single-Threaded Leadership

The authors discuss the concept of Separable, Single-Threaded Leadership, where leaders are dedicated to a single project or goal, reducing the complexity and increasing accountability. This organisational structure is key to Amazon's ability to innovate and execute efficiently.

#### Chapter 4: Communicating: Narratives and the Six-Pager

Amazon replaces PowerPoint presentations with written narratives and six-page memos to ensure thorough understanding and well-considered decision-making. The chapter explains how this approach leads to clearer communication and better outcomes.

#### Chapter 5: Working Backwards: Start with the Desired Customer Experience

The Working Backwards process starts with the desired customer experience and then works backwards to achieve it. This chapter outlines how Amazon uses this method to develop new products and services, ensuring they meet customer needs.

#### Chapter 6: Metrics: Manage Your Inputs, Not Your Outputs

Amazon focuses on managing input metrics—actions and behaviours that drive desired outcomes—rather than output metrics. This approach allows the company to proactively manage its performance and adapt quickly.

### Part Two: The Invention Machine at Work

#### Chapter 7: Kindle

The development of the Kindle is explored as a case study in innovation. The authors describe how the Working Backwards process and other Amazon principles were applied to create a product that revolutionised reading.

#### Chapter 8: Prime

Prime’s creation and evolution highlight Amazon’s commitment to customer obsession and long-term thinking. The chapter discusses how Amazon continuously adds value to Prime to enhance customer loyalty.

#### Chapter 9: Prime Video

The launch and growth of Prime Video demonstrate Amazon's strategy of leveraging existing assets and innovating to create new customer experiences. The chapter details the challenges and successes in building a competitive streaming service.

#### Chapter 10: AWS

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is presented as a prime example of Amazon's ability to enter and dominate entirely new markets. The authors explain the strategic decisions and leadership that made AWS a market leader.
